# How to setup development environment of spartaproject

## STEP1: Communication language

See Language section of [README.md](README.md)

## STEP2: Operating system (OS)

We basically develop Sparta on Linux, and its running on Windows WSL. Test of this library is executed on both of Linux (Required) and Windows (Optional).

### Verified OS

- Linux: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
- Windows: 10 Pro 22H2 (64bit)

## STEP3: Integrated development environment (IDE)

We basically develop on Visual Studio Code (VCCode).

### Verified IDE

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Use latest version.

## STEP4: Programming language

We basically develop on Python.

### Verified version

- [Python-3.13.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3131/)

### More dependent libraries

## STEP5: Outside development tools

### Run Linux commands on Windows

We use gow for the compatibility layer of Linux from Windows. But if it works, anything is fine.
